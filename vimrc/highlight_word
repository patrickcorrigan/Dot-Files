" Highlight Word {{{
" Stolen from Steve.
" This mini-plugin provides a few mappings for highlighting words temporarily.
"
" Sometimes you're looking at a hairy piece of code and would like a certain
" word or two to stand out temporarily.  You can search for it, but that only
" gives you one color of highlighting.  Now you can use <leader>N where N is
" a number from 1-6 to highlight the current word in a specific color.

function! HighlightInterestingWord(n) " {{{
    " Save our location.
    normal! mz

    " Yank the current word into the z register.
    normal! "zyiw

    " Calculate an arbitrary match ID.  Hopefully nothing else is using it.
    let mid = 86750 + a:n

    " Clear existing matches, but don't worry if they don't exist.
    silent! call matchdelete(mid)

    " Construct a literal pattern that has to match at boundaries.
    let pat = '\V\<' . escape(@z, '\') . '\>'

    " Actually match the words.
    call matchadd("InterestingWord" . a:n, pat, 1, mid)

    " Move back to our original location.
    normal! `z
